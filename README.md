# SEDE

## Introduction

SEDE stands for Simulator-based Explanations of DNN-Errors, a tool that is used to generate explanations for DNN errors with any simulator.
SEDE is a cluster-based approach that relies on the clusters generated by HUDD, but might be used with any generated clusters.

## NOTICE on dependencies and libraries

SEDE is a toolset that might be used to generate explanations for DNN errors with any simulator.
However, for our experiments we rely on the faces simulator developed by IEE S.A. (https://iee-sensing.com)
We refer to such simulator as IEE-Face-Simulator.
The released implementation of SEDE invokes the IEE-Face-Simulator through a program call (i.e., not through APIs).
SEDE makes use of two versions of IEE-Face-Simulator, v0.5, which is in directory IEE_V1, and v1.0, which is in directory IEE_V2.

Both the two versions of the IEE-Face-Simulator are released with GPL v3 licence (see files 'gpl-3.0.txt' in both directories).
The directory IEEPackage is Copyright (C) 2018-2022 IEE S.A. (https://iee-sensing.com) released with GPL v3 licence.

## USAGE

To run the tool you need to have the case studies setup in a separated directory and then generate HUDD clusters using the command

> python SEDE.py -o ./HPD -SEDE HUDD

To run SEDE, you need to specify the IEE-Face-Simulator version (options are 1 or 2) and the algorithm to use (options are SEDE or DeepJanus)

> python SEDE.py -o ./HPD -iee 1 -SEDE SEDE
> python SEDE.py -o ./HPD -iee 1 -SEDE DeepJanus

To run the evaluation you need to use the following command:

> python SEDE.py -SEDE RQ1

where RQx is the RQ to be evaluated (options are RQ1, RQ2, RQ3, RQ4, RQ5)
N.B.: for RQ1 you need to have the RQ1 directory shared with the replicability package inside the parent directory of this file
